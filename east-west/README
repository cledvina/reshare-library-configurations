To set up library structures for "East" and "West" demo ReShare libraries on a freshly installed FOLIO instance

- delete sample inventory records (if any)
- delete sample institutions and locations
- create the East and West library and locations structures

A script setting variables for the host and tenant to update must be invoked. In the project 
is a settings file for tenant 'diku' at 'localhost' and another for 'si-cardinal'. Username and
password for a user with suitable permissions in that tenant must be provided on the command line.

So to clear out FOLIO's default sample locations for 'diku' on localhost, do:

./delete-folio-sample-locations.sh diku@localhost:9130.sh diku_admin admin 

And to install East's and West's locations and library codes, do:

./create-sample-library-structure.sh diku@localhost:9130.sh diku_admin admin
